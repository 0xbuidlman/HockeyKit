Requirements:
- Server software available and installed
- The iOS application needs to be build with base SDK set to 4.0 or higher

Important:
- This code may NEVER be used in an app version distributed to Apple!
- Make sure to #IFDEF the code when building for AppStore distribution.

E.g. use where appropriate (if your configuration is named AppStore_Distribution):
#if !defined (CONFIGURATION_AppStore_Distribution)
#import "BWHockeyManager.h"
#endif


Include Client Code:
- It is assumed that the server is already installed, refer to the server README for more details
- Import the files into your project, if you already have a JSONKit or SBJson added to your project, you don't need to add them again.
- Include the header as shown above
- Include the library in application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: via
#if !defined (CONFIGURATION_AppStore_Distribution)
    [BWHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager].updateURL = @"YourUrlPointToThePathWhereTheIndexPHPFileIsLocated";
#endif

- Replace the URL
- Add the BWHockeyViewController to your In-App Settings page
- Optionally include the strings localization, example file present in the demo project
- Version numbers are compared via CFBundleVersion value of the apps main bundle


Notes:
- Check the server README for how to create a new build and distribute it via the update mechanism
